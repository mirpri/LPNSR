"""
LPIPS Perceptual Loss (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity)

Design Philosophy:
LPIPS is a deep learning-based perceptual similarity metric that measures perceptual differences
between images using features extracted from pre-trained networks.
Compared to traditional pixel-level losses (such as L1, L2), LPIPS can better
capture the human visual system's perception of image quality.

Core Advantages:
1. Perceptual consistency: Highly correlated with human perception
2. Feature-level comparison: Captures high-level semantic information
3. Pre-trained advantage: Leverages representations learned from large-scale datasets
4. Multi-scale features: Combines feature information at different hierarchical levels

    LPIPS Perceptual Loss

    This loss function uses pre-trained deep networks to extract features and
    calculate perceptual similarity between images.
    LPIPS has been proven to be highly correlated with human perception
    and is widely used in image generation, super-resolution, and other tasks.

    Args:
        loss_weight: Loss weight for multi-loss weighting
        net_type: Pre-trained network type, optional 'alex'(AlexNet), 'vgg'(VGG), 'squeeze'(SqueezeNet)
                  Default is 'alex', which has the highest computational efficiency and good performance
        use_gpu: Whether to use GPU acceleration, default True
        spatial: Whether to return spatial dimension loss map, default False
        normalize: Whether to normalize input to [-1, 1] range, default True

    Examples:
        >>> criterion = LPIPSLoss(loss_weight=0.5, net_type='alex')
        >>> pred = torch.randn(4, 3, 256, 256)  # Needs 3-channel RGB image
        >>> target = torch.randn(4, 3, 256, 256)
        >>> loss = criterion(pred, target)

    Note:
        - Input images should be in RGB format, 3 channels
        - Input range should be [-1, 1] or [0, 1] (automatically handled if normalize=True)
        - LPIPS model parameters are frozen and do not participate in training
